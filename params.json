  "body": "### GreenRobot Adserver.\r\nHave accounts at Adsense and LifeStreetmedia for your website or Facebook app? Rotate them using this open source PHP ad server. The ad server connects to Google Adsense and Lifestreetmedia to calculate which network will make you more money and chooses which ad to display based on that. For Adsense and Lifestreetmedia, the RPM is automatically retrieved by the server using network APIs, for other networks you will have to edit the RPM yourself.\r\n\r\nThis adserver is for desktop sites and mobile web, not native mobile apps. Specifically, I use it on a Facebook app, which is also accessible outside of the Facebook frame once you're logged in via Facebook connect. It should also work fine on desktop or mobile web sites not using Facebook login. I also do mobile development, so maybe I will get around to building a native apps adserver in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n- Andy Triboletti @andytriboletti\r\n- A remote contractor from Upwork.com\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\n[Contact support](https://greenrobot.com/support) and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.\r\n",
